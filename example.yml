#each motor needs a speed as data
Motors:
    M0: 0.2
    M1: 3
    M2: -1
    
#each sensor has normal distribution of noise with a mean and sigma.
Sensors:
    S0: 0, 0.4
    S1: 0.2 , 1


#functions can have other motors or sensors and basic +,-,*,/,^ please keep a space between tokens, M0 refers to the current M0 position, S1 to sensor1 noise level.
Functions:
    F1: M0 = 0.8 * M0 + ( S0 - 1 ) * 2
    F2: M1 = S1 / 10 + 5
